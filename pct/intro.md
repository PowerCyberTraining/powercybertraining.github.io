# PowerCyber Training

Welcome to the PowerCyber Training website! We are glad to see you here!

This website hosts training materials for power engineering researchers to learn
about modern cyberinfrastructure (CI) technologies. The goal is to equip
researchers with the skills to apply CI technologies for research advancement.
These lessons are designed to be hands-on and self-paced,
meaning that you can work through them by running the code examples and
following the explanations.

This is an ongoing project, and materials will be added and updated regularly.
Lessons are being updated to include an information table at the beginning. The
table will indicate the status of the lesson (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed").
We thank you for your patience as we work to complete the materials.

To start, please click on the "Next" link at the bottom of this page. You can
also use the arrow key on your keyboard to navigate through the website.
