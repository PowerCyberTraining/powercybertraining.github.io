# How to use this book

This book is designed to be *interactive* and *hands-on*. To get the most out of your learning experience, we recommend the following approach:

## Setting up your environment

1. **Begin with Module 1**: Start by following the environment setup instructions in Module 1, which will guide you through installing necessary tools (WSL for Windows users, command-line basics, package managers, and development environments).

2. **Install required software**: Each module specifies the required software and Python packages. Take time to properly set up your local environment as this will be the foundation for all future work.

## Working through the notebooks

3. **Run the notebooks locally**: Download the notebook files from the repository and run them on your local machine using Jupyter. This allows you to experiment with the code interactively.

4. **Type the code yourself**: While you can copy and paste code snippets, we strongly encourage you to type them manually. This practice reinforces learning and helps you catch nuances in the syntax and structure of the code.

5. **Experiment and explore**: Don't just execute the provided code. Try modifying parameters, asking "what if" questions, and exploring alternative approaches. The best learning happens when you're actively engaged.

## Problem-solving approach

6. **Complete the exercises**: Each module contains exercises designed to reinforce concepts. Attempt them before looking at solutions.

7. **Build incrementally**: Start with the basics and progressively work through more complex problems. Your understanding will deepen with each step.

8. **Collaborate and discuss**: While working through the material, engage with peers when possible. Explaining concepts to others reinforces your own understanding.

## Moving between modules

The training is organized in a progressive manner, with each module building upon previous ones:

- **Module 1**: Environment setup and basic tools
- **Module 2**: Data analysis fundamentals with NumPy, Pandas, and time-series analysis
- **Module 3**: Solving equations and power flow analysis
- **Module 4**: Introduction to linear programming and grid optimization
- **Module 6**: Advanced topics in transmission and distribution systems

Take your time with each module before moving to the next and ensure you have
mastered the fundamental concepts before moving on to advanced material.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises but to develop a deep
understanding of the concepts and tools that will empower you in your power
engineering career.
