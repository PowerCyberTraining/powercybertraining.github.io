    "# Using the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "## Landing in the Linux Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a new Linux terminal, you will see a prompt like\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prompt, `User` is the username, `Machine` is the machine name, and `~`\n",
    "stands for the home directory, which is the current working directory. The colon\n",
    "`:` is a separator between the machine name and the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt character is `$` for a regular user and `#` for a superuser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate the file system in the shell, you will most likely use the following\n",
    "commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cd`: Change directory\n",
    "- `ls`: List files and directories\n",
    "- `pwd`: Print working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory. When a single\n",
    "argument is passed, namely, the path to the directory, the current working\n",
    "directory is changed to the specified directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ cd /tmp\n",
    "User@Machine:/tmp$ cd ..\n",
    "User@Machine:/$ cd\n",
    "User@Machine:~$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command\n",
    "`cd /tmp` specifies an absolute path `/tmp`, so the working directory is changed\n",
    "accordingly as you see in the second command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second command `cd ..` changes the directory to the parent directory. `..` is\n",
    "a relative path to the parent directory. As a result, the directory changed from\n",
    "`/tmp` to `/`. In Linux, `/` is known as the root directory. Every directory has\n",
    "an absolute path that starts from the root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third command `cd` without any argument changes the directory to the home\n",
    "directory. The home directory is the directory where the user is located. The\n",
    "directory change can be confirmed by the `pwd` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Case Sensitivity\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux is case-sensitive because UNIX is.\n",
    "It is case sensitive, meaning that all the *command* and\n",
    "*file names* are case sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, this might feel a bit confusing when you are used to Windows.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Print Working Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pwd` command prints the absolute path of the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ pwd\n",
    "/home/User\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common to use relative paths when changing directories. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:/home$ cd User\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ pwd\n",
    "/home/User\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "confirms that changing to the folder `User` relative to the current directory\n",
    "`/home` is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    "Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `/etc` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once in there, use the `pwd` command to confirm your current directory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Files and Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ls` command is used to list the files and directories in the current\n",
    "directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ls` can accept a path to a directory as an argument. It will then list the\n",
    "items in the specified directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ls` can take arguments. A few commonly used arguments are\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-a`: Show all files and directories, including hidden ones\n",
    "- `-l`: Show detailed information about the files and directories\n",
    "- `-t`: Sort the files and directories by time\n",
    "- `-r`: Reverse the order of the files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "These options can be combined. For example, `ls -lrt` is equivalent to\n",
    "`ls -l -r -t`, which will list the files and directories in the current\n",
    "directory in reverse order of time. The combination is agnostic to the option\n",
    "order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To list files that match a pattern, one can use the wildcard `*`. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ ls f*.txt\n",
    "file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command lists all files that start with `f` and end with `.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Hidden files and directories\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden files and directories are named to start with a dot `.`.\n",
    "They are not displayed by `ls` but are shown by `ls -a`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    "Use the `ls` command to list files and directories in the `/var` directory. Include hidden files in your listing. Then, sort the files by modification time.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make a Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mkdir` command is used to make a directory. It can take a path to the\n",
    "directory as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove\n",
    "\n",
    "Two commands are used to remove files and directories. `rm` is used to remove\n",
    "files or directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "`rmdir` is used to remove empty directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a directory and a file in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ mkdir test\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ ls\n",
    "test\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ touch test/file.txt\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ ls test\n",
    "file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `touch` command is used to create a new & empty file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the directory `test` is not empty, `rmdir` will not work.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ rmdir test\n",
    "rmdir: test: Directory not empty\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One can remove the directory `test` with `rm -r test`. The option `-r` stands\n",
    "for recursive, meaning that the folder and everything (files and subfolders)\n",
    "inside will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ rm -r test\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} No Recycle Bin on Linux\n",
    ":class: caution\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux bash does not have a built-in recycle bin.\n",
    "Files deleted with `rm` are gone forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "If unsure, use `mv` to rename the file or move it to a temporary location.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    "In your *home directory*, create a new directory named `power_logs`. \n",
    "Inside `power_logs`, create an empty file named `session1.log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify the directory and file were created correctly.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copy and Move\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands for copy and move are `cp` and `mv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format for calling both commands is `command SOURCE DESTINATION`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below makes a copy of `file.txt` to `file2.txt`.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ cp file.txt file2.txt\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ ls\n",

    "User@Machine:~$ mv file2.txt test\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ ls test\n",
    "file2.txt\n",

    "file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    "Back to the `power_logs` folder, copy `session1.log` to a new file named `session1_backup.log` in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Move `session1_backup.log` to a new directory under `power_logs` named `backup`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### View File Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cat` command is used to view the content of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ cat file.txt\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find` command is used to search for files in a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ find . -iname \"file.txt\"\n",
    "./file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `-iname` is the combination of `-i` for case-insensitive search and\n",
    "`-name` for specifying the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search in Files\n",
    "\n",
    "`grep` is used to search for a pattern in a plain-text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ grep -i \"hello\" file.txt\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify a path to the file or use a wildcard to search in multiple\n",

    "User@Machine:~$ grep -iR \"hello\" .\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",

    "## Advanced Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Echo / Display Text\n",
    "\n",
    "The `echo` command is used to display a line of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `echo` command is powerful when combined with other commands, such as the\n",
    "redirection operator `>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redirection\n",
    "\n",
    "The redirection operator `>` redirects the output of a shell command to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ echo \"Hello, World!\" > file.txt\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ cat file.txt\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of redirection operators. `>` overwrites the file, while\n",

    "```{admonition} Further Reading: Linux File Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, everything is a file. That includes the standard input, output, and\n",
    "standard error. They correspond to file descriptors 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `>` redirects the standard output (file descriptor 1) to a file.\n",
    "- `2>` redirects the standard error (file descriptor 2) to a file.\n",
    "- `&>` redirects both the standard output and standard error to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment variables are used to store information that can be used by\n",
    "programs. They are set in the shell and are inherited by child processes. The\n",
    "`env` command is used to list the environment variables. You will likely see a\n",
    "long output with many variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best known environment variable is `PATH`. It is a colon-separated list of\n",
    "directories where the shell looks for executable files. When you type a command,\n",
    "the shell looks for the command in the directories listed in the `PATH`\n",
    "variable. This is how you can run a command without specifying the full path.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out where a command is located, you can use the `which` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ which ls\n",
    "/usr/bin/ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command shows that the `ls` command is located at `/usr/bin/ls`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Ownership\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be times you run into permission issues. This often happens when you\n",
    "use the `root` user (superuser) to run a command. For example, you probably have\n",
    "used `sudo` to install a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you accidentally run a command as the superuser, all the files and\n",
    "directories created by the command will be owned by the superuser. A regular\n",
    "issue will then not be able to modify or remove the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `chown` command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory. The\n",
    "format is `chown OWNER:GROUP FILES`. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ chown User:staff file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "changes the ownership of `file.txt` to the `User` user and the `staff` group.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to change the ownership from `root` to yourself, you will need to\n",
    "use `sudo`, because only the superuser can relinquish its ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User@Machine:~$ sudo chown User:staff file.txt\n",

    "### Pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipes `|` are used to connect the output of one command to the input of another\n",
    "command. A basic idea of UNIX is that you can chain commands together to do\n",
    "complex tasks. Pipes are what makes the shell powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `ls -l` lists the files and folders, By inspection of\n",
    "`ls -l`, you can tell that the first line is the heading that indicates the\n",
    "number of disk blocks used. The rest of the lines are the files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `wc -l` counts the number of lines. You can combine them to count\n",

    "25\n",
    "```\n",
