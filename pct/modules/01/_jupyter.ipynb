    "4. You can delete a cell using `dd`.\n",

    "   focus to the next cell. If this is the last cell, a new one will be inserted.\n",
    "6. Merge a cell with the cell below it using `Shift+M`.\n",
    "7. To split a cell into two, move the focus to the line where you want to split,\n",

    "\n",
    "### Line Magics (%)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `%timeit`: Time the execution of a single line of code\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   %timeit [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sort()\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "3. `%who`: List all variables in the current namespace\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   %who\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `%load`: Load code from an external file\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   %load my_script.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell Magics (%%)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `%%time`: Time the execution of an entire cell. This is useful when you want to understand the performance of a code block\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   %%time\n",
    "   import time\n",
    "   for i in range(1000000):\n",
    "       _ = i**2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `%%writefile`: Write the contents of a cell to a file\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   %%writefile example.py\n",
    "   def hello():\n",
    "       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `%%html`: Render the cell as HTML\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   %%html\n",
    "   <h1>This is a header</h1>\n",
    "   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "You can get a list of all available magic commands by running `%lsmagic`. To get help on a specific magic command, you can use `%magic_command?` (e.g., `%timeit?`).\n",

    "Magic commands are a powerful feature of Jupyter that can help you write more efficient and interactive notebooks. Experiment with different magic commands to find the ones that best suit your workflow!"

    "\n",
    "Extensions can be installed by clicking on the \"puzzle piece\" icon. Upon the first use, one will be warned about the risks of using third-party extensions. After acknowledging the risks, one can use the search feature to find extensions, or browse all of them.\n",

Also, setting a password for your Jupyter server is an important security measure, especially if you're running Jupyter on a network where others might access it. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. First, generate a config file if you don't already have one:\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter notebook --generate-config\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, set up a password:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter notebook password\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You'll be prompted to enter and verify your password.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This will create a hashed password in your Jupyter config file. You can now start Jupyter normally, and you'll be required to enter this password to access your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, it's crucial to choose a strong, unique password to protect your Jupyter environment and any sensitive data in your notebooks.\n",
