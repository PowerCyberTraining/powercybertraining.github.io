# Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Introduction

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that allows one to
create a Linux environment within Windows. WSL eliminates the need for a
virtual machine or dual-boot to use Linux. WSL was originally created to meet the
demand from users who want to use Linux BASH productivity tools in Windows
{cite}`why-was-wsl-created`.


`````{admonition} How is WSL different from a virtual machine?
:class: tip
You may have used a virtual machine to run Linux on Windows, such as VirtualBox
or VMware. These virtual machines software emulates a physical computer from the
ground up on the host operating system. WSL is different by using a
compatibility layer that is transparent to the user to run Linux applications.
