    "## Text Viewing and Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic File Viewing\n",
    "\n",
    "Several commands are available for viewing file contents, each with different strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cat` - Display entire file content\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cat filename.txt          # Show file content\n",
    "   cat -n filename.txt      # Show with line numbers\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `less` - View long files page by page\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   less filename.txt        # View file with scrolling\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Use `Space` to move forward one page\n",
    "   - Use `b` to move back one page\n",
    "   - Use `/` to search for text\n",
    "   - Press `q` to quit\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `head` and `tail` - View start or end of files\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   head filename.txt        # Show first 10 lines\n",
    "   head -n 5 filename.txt   # Show first 5 lines\n",
    "   tail filename.txt        # Show last 10 lines\n",
    "   tail -f log.txt         # Watch file in real-time (useful for logs)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `more` - Simple file pager (older version of `less`)\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   more filename.txt       # View file page by page\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining View Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine these commands for more specific views:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# View lines 5-10 of a file\n",
    "head -n 10 filename.txt | tail -n 6\n",
    "\n",
    "# Watch the last few lines of a log file\n",
    "tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep \"error\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, you may need to edit a file in the shell. There are several\n",
    "editors available. The most common ones are `nano`, `vim`, and `emacs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nano (Beginner-friendly)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nano` editor is a simple text editor that is available on most Linux\n",
    "distributions. It is easy to use: to edit a file, do `nano FILENAME`. When\n",
    "`nano` opens, just type your text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit `nano`, press `Ctrl` + `X`. If you have unsaved changes, `nano` will ask\n",
    "you confirm.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Vim has two modes, normal mode and insert mode. In normal mode, you can navigate\n",
    "and execute commands. In insert mode, you can type text. You enter insert mode by\n",
    "pressing `i`, and you exit back to normal mode by pressing `Esc`.\n",

    "To save a file, you can type `:w`. To save and exit, you can type `:wq`.\n",

    "are plenty of materials to teach yourself.\n",
