# Tools You Need

## Motivation

There has been a lot of development in computational tools for science and
engineering. Yet, many of these tools have not been introduced in a typical
electric power engineering curriculum. It remains a challenge for individual
researchers to figure out how to install, configure, and efficiently use these
tools for research.

Most power engineering researchers are familiar with the Microsoft Windows
operating system and the MATLAB software. However, many of the advanced
cyberinfrastructure tools are developed on Linux and thus compile more easily
and run more efficiently in Linux. On the other hand, compiling and configuring
some tools to properly run on Windows may take significantly more efforts.
Having a basic understanding of Linux and the command line interface is
important for research productivity.

This module aims to provide an introduction to several tools on Linux. These
include
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Shell
- Anaconda/Mambaforge
- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebook
- git
