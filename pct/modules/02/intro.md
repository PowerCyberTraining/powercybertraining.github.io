# Part 1:Data analytics and visualization in Python
## Overview: Time Series Data Analysis 

### Objective

This module aims to provide an in-depth analysis of historical time series data from the power grid system of Great Britain spanning multiple years (2016–2023). The objective is to analyze grid frequency trends, detect anomalies, and understand seasonal variations using Python-based data analytics and visualization tools. By leveraging libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, this module enables users to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
