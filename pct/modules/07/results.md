# Results

## Key Findings
- The `is_daytime` feature was identified as the most important factor, indicating that temporal aspects significantly influence predictions.
- Feature importance visualization revealed a clear hierarchy of features based on their contribution to the model's success.

## Insights
1. **Temporal Factors**: Time-of-day strongly affects outcomes, as shown by the high importance of `is_daytime`.
2. **Interpretability**: The analysis provides actionable insights for decision-making and resource optimization.

## Future Work
- Introduce additional temporal features, such as `is_weekend` or `holiday_indicator`, to improve the model.
- Compare model performance with alternative algorithms and advanced explainability tools like SHAP or LIME.
