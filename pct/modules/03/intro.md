# Numerical Methods for Power Systems

## Module Overview

Power systems analysis fundamentally relies on solving large-scale mathematical problems that cannot be addressed analytically. Every time operators dispatch generators, market software clears bids, or planning engineers evaluate contingencies, numerical algorithms work behind the scenes to find solutions to systems of equations with thousands or even millions of variables. Understanding these numerical foundations transforms power systems from abstract mathematical models into computable engineering problems that can be solved efficiently and reliably.

The transition from textbook power flow equations to practical software
implementation requires the understanding of numerical techniques. While power
systems courses
teach the physics and mathematics of electrical networks, implementing these
concepts demands understanding how computers actually solve equations, handle
numerical precision, and manage computational complexity. This module bridges
that gap, showing how fundamental numerical methods enable the power system
software that keeps lights on across continents.

### Module Structure

This module progresses from foundational numerical concepts to complete power system applications. We begin with linear systems, the workhorses of scientific computing that underpin everything from state estimation to optimal power flow. Building on this foundation, we tackle nonlinear equations through Newton-Raphson and other iterative methods, essential for AC power flow analysis. The module culminates in object-oriented implementations that mirror professional power system software design.

Throughout the lessons, you will:

- Understand sparse matrix techniques crucial for large-scale power systems
- Implement Newton-Raphson solvers for nonlinear power flow equations  
- Build complete DC and AC power flow solvers from scratch
- Apply symbolic computation for automated Jacobian generation
- Design object-oriented frameworks for extensible power system analysis

Each implementation uses real power system test cases, from small tutorial systems to large-scale networks with thousands of buses, ensuring you understand both the theory and practical computational challenges.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Solve linear and nonlinear equation systems using appropriate numerical methods
- Implement sparse matrix algorithms for efficient large-scale computations
- Build AC and DC power flow solvers using Newton-Raphson techniques
- Apply object-oriented programming principles to power system software design
- Use symbolic computation tools for automating mathematical derivations
- Debug and optimize numerical algorithms for power system applications

### Prerequisites

This module builds on mathematical and programming foundations from earlier modules:

- **Module 01**: Python environment setup, Jupyter notebooks
- **Module 02**: NumPy arrays, scientific computing with SciPy

Mathematical background needed includes basic linear algebra (matrix operations, eigenvalues) and calculus (derivatives, Taylor series). Prior exposure to power flow equations is helpful but not required. We build these concepts from first principles.
