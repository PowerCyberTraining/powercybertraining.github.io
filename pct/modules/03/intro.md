# Optimization and Electricity Markets

## Module Overview

Optimization forms the mathematical foundation of modern power system operations and electricity markets. Every five minutes, system operators solve complex optimization problems to determine which generators should run, how power should flow through the network, and what prices should be set at different locations. This module introduces the optimization techniques that make efficient, reliable grid operation possible.

The transition from vertically integrated utilities to competitive electricity markets has not reduced the importance of optimization - it has transformed it. Where utilities once optimized to minimize total system cost, markets now use optimization to maximize social welfare while respecting the same physical constraints. Understanding these optimization problems is essential for anyone working in power system planning, operations, or policy.

This module builds systematically from fundamental concepts to real-world applications. We begin with the basics of optimization theory, teaching you to recognize and formulate optimization problems. We then dive into linear programming, the workhorse technique for large-scale power system problems. With these tools established, we explore how electricity markets use optimization to set prices and dispatch resources. Finally, we tackle the complex optimization problems at the heart of grid operations, from unit commitment to optimal power flow.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Formulate optimization problems** - Transform verbal descriptions of power system challenges into mathematical optimization models with appropriate objectives and constraints

2. **Implement linear programs in Python** - Use modern optimization libraries to solve linear programming problems, debug infeasible models, and interpret results

3. **Understand electricity market mechanisms** - Implement market clearing algorithms, calculate locational marginal prices, and analyze the economic implications of transmission constraints

4. **Apply optimization to grid operations** - Solve economic dispatch, unit commitment, and security-constrained optimization problems using industry-standard techniques

5. **Handle advanced optimization challenges** - Address uncertainty, multiple objectives, and computational complexity in realistic power system applications

### Prerequisites

This module assumes you have completed Module 02 or have equivalent experience with:
- Python programming fundamentals, including functions and data structures
- NumPy for numerical computation and matrix operations
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Basic linear algebra concepts (matrices, systems of equations)

No prior knowledge of optimization or electricity markets is required. We will build these concepts from the ground up using power system examples.

### Hands-On Learning Approach

Every lesson emphasizes practical implementation. You will write code to solve real optimization problems, not just study theory. Exercises progress from simple formulations to complex, multi-period problems with numerous constraints. Solutions are hidden by default to encourage independent problem-solving, but are available when you need them.

We use open-source optimization tools throughout, ensuring you can apply these techniques in your own work without expensive licenses. You'll learn not just how to use these tools, but how to debug when things go wrong - a critical skill for real-world optimization.
