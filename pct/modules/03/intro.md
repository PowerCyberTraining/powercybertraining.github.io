# Optimization and Electricity Market

## Overview: An example of a power system optimization problem



### Objective

This module leverages cyber infrastructure to conduct a day-ahead economic dispatch on a modified PJM 5-bus system, demonstrating how cyber infrastructure can be utilized to model and solve a power system optimization problem. The cyber infrastructure leveraged in this module includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, GurobiPy, and Matplotlib.



### Key Components

1.	Inputting system parameters and calculating the Shift Factors matrix.
2.	Formulating the optimization model and solving the optimization problem.
3.	Extracting the optimization results and displaying the outcomes.


This module provides an effective PowerCyber training, facilitating the utilization of cyber infrastructure to conduct studies and research in the power domain.
