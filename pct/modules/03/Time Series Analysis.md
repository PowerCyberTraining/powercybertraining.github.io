# Time Series Analysis

A time series is a sequence of data points recorded at specific time intervals. Here, each observation corresponds to a second, and we are interested in observing the data for specific months as well as how the data changes over months and years.

#### Key Metrics for Analysis

**Monthly Averages**: What are the average values for each month across different years? This  helps detect seasonal trends.

**Probability of Outliers**: Is there a huge fluctuation in the data with many outliers? This helps detect the randomness and consistancy of our observation.

**CPS1 score with 10-min data**: Determination of efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

**Month-over-Month Changes**: How do the metrics vary from one month to the next?

**Year-over-Year Changes**: How do the metrics vary from one year to the next?
