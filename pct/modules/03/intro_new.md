# Optimization and Electricity Markets

## Module Overview

Optimization forms the mathematical foundation of modern power system operations and electricity markets. To reliably operate power systems, the operators need to schedule the generation resources to match the system total load continuously. This generation scheduling problem is basic in power system operation, which is called "Economic Dispatch" (ED). In real-time operation, every five minutes, system operators solve complex ED optimization problems to determine which generators should run, how power should flow through the network, and what prices should be set at different locations. This module introduces the optimization techniques that make efficient, reliable grid operation possible.

The transition from vertically integrated utilities to competitive electricity markets has not reduced the importance of optimization - it has transformed it. Where utilities once optimized to minimize total system cost, markets now use optimization to maximize social welfare while respecting the same physical constraints. More importantly, the market should set the price of electricity after solving the ED optimization problems. Understanding these optimization problems is essential for anyone working in power system planning, operations, or policy.

This module builds systematically from fundamental concepts to real-world applications. We begin with the basics of optimization theory, teaching you to recognize and formulate optimization problems. We then dive into linear programming, the workhorse technique for large-scale power system problems. With these tools established, we explore how electricity markets use optimization to set prices and dispatch resources. Finally, we tackle the complex optimization problems at the heart of grid operations, from unit commitment to optimal power flow.

## Module Structure

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Optimization (2 hours)
Establish fundamental optimization concepts through power system examples. Learn to identify decision variables, objectives, and constraints in verbal problem descriptions. Understand different problem types (linear, nonlinear, integer) and their implications for solvability. Practice formulating optimization problems mathematically and solving simple cases graphically.

### Lesson 2: Linear Programming with Python (2 hours)
Master the practical skills needed to solve linear optimization problems. Compare different Python optimization libraries and their strengths. Build LP models systematically from problem statements. Debug common issues like infeasibility and unboundedness. Extract and interpret both primal solutions (optimal decisions) and dual solutions (marginal values).

### Lesson 3: Electricity Market Fundamentals (2 hours)
Understand how competitive electricity markets use optimization to coordinate decentralized decisions. Implement basic market clearing mechanisms and see how prices emerge from supply, demand, and network constraints. Explore the relationship between engineering constraints and economic signals through locational marginal pricing. Learn about multi-settlement markets and ancillary service co-optimization.

### Lesson 4: Power System Optimization Applications (2 hours)
Apply optimization techniques to core grid operation problems. Implement economic dispatch with realistic constraints like ramping and emissions. Solve unit commitment problems using mixed-integer programming. Add security constraints to ensure N-1 reliability. Compare DC and AC optimal power flow formulations. Address modern challenges from renewable integration.

### Lesson 5: Advanced Topics and Case Studies (2 hours)
Tackle cutting-edge optimization challenges in power systems. Handle uncertainty through stochastic and robust optimization approaches. Balance multiple objectives like cost, emissions, and reliability. Apply decomposition techniques to solve large-scale problems. Work through comprehensive case studies in storage optimization and transmission planning.

## Hands-On Learning Approach

Every lesson emphasizes practical implementation. You will write code to solve real optimization problems, not just study theory. Exercises progress from simple formulations to complex, multi-period problems with numerous constraints. Solutions are hidden by default to encourage independent problem-solving, but are available when you need them.

We use open-source optimization tools throughout, ensuring you can apply these techniques in your own work without expensive licenses. You'll learn not just how to use these tools, but how to debug when things go wrong - a critical skill for real-world optimization.

## Connection to Industry Practice

The optimization problems in this module are not academic exercises - they are simplified versions of models running in control rooms and market systems worldwide. Independent System Operators use similar formulations to dispatch generators, clear markets, and maintain reliability. Utilities apply these techniques for generation planning and grid investments. Understanding these models helps you interpret market outcomes, identify system needs, and design better policies.

As you work through the module, you'll gain insight into why electricity markets are designed as they are, what drives price formation, and how physical constraints shape economic outcomes. This knowledge is invaluable whether you're analyzing market data, proposing new resources, or designing market rules.

## Assessment Approach

Each lesson includes exercises that test both conceptual understanding and practical implementation skills. You'll formulate optimization problems from word descriptions, implement solutions in Python, debug problematic models, and interpret results in power system context. Quiz questions probe your understanding of when different techniques apply and what their limitations are.

The module culminates in comprehensive case studies where you'll apply multiple techniques to solve realistic problems. These cases prepare you to tackle novel optimization challenges in your own work.

## Getting Started

Begin with Lesson 1 to build a solid conceptual foundation. Even if you have some optimization background, the power system context and problem formulation practice will be valuable. Each lesson builds on previous material, so work through them in order. Set aside time for the exercises - actively solving problems is the best way to master optimization.

Remember that optimization is both an art and a science. While the mathematical techniques are precise, formulating good models requires judgment and experience. This module provides that experience through diverse power system examples. By the end, you'll be equipped to recognize optimization opportunities in power systems and implement effective solutions.
