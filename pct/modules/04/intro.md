# Numerical Methods and Simulation 

## Overview

This module will review the numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations
and finding the eigenvalues of a matrix. These methods are part of the “Power
System Analysis and Computation Methods” curriculum. The NumPy scientific
computing ecosystem will be presented for formulating, solving, and visualizing
power system problems, including power flow analysis and eigenvalue analysis. We
will introduce computer algebra and code generation based on SymPy to streamline
modeling and simulation. Techniques to simulate power transmission systems will
be discussed in the ANDES simulator.

## Motivation

While not everyone aspires to write full-fledged numerical programs, it is
helpful to understand how basic and advanced numerical methods can be used in
the Python ecosystem. In addition, the skills to write simple numerical programs
will make one more versatile in analyzing data and solving real-world problems.
