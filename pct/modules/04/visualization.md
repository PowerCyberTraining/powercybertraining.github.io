# Visualizations

## Feature Importance
The notebook includes a **bar chart** displaying the relative importance of each feature. Key details include:
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**:
  - Ranks features by their importance scores.
  - Helps identify features with the most significant impact on model predictions.
- **Most Important Feature**: 
  - `is_daytime`, a boolean indicating whether the observation time falls between 6 AM and 6 PM, emerged as the top predictor.

## Tools
- **Matplotlib** was used for visualization.
- Figures are clear and accessible for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
